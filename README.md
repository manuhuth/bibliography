# Bibliography
Bib file for the references used in my research. Can be incorporated easily into the workflow of any project. The keys follow the style FirstAuthor.PuclicationYear, e.g. Schweikert.2021 for [this](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/coep.12532) article. The entries are designed to work best with biber and its citation style apalike.
